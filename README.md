The Store Discounts

On a retail website, the following discounts apply:

1. If the user has gold card of the store, he gets a 30% discount
2. If the user has silver card of the store, he gets a 20% discount
3. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
4. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
5. For every $200 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 950, you get $ 20
as a discount).
6. The percentage based discounts do not apply on phones.
7. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.
Write a program in java such that given a bill, it finds the net payable amount. User interface is not required. 

What we care about:

Required Activities

- Object oriented programming approach, provide a high level UML class diagram of all the key classes in your solution. This can either be on paper or using a CASE tool
- Code to be generic and simple
- Leverage today's best coding practices
- Clear README.md that explains how the code and the test can be run and how the coverage reports can be generated
