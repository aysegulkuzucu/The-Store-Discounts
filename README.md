The Store Discounts

On a retail website, the following discounts apply:
If the user has gold card of the store, he gets a 30% discount
If the user has silver card of the store, he gets a 20% discount
2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
4. For every $200 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 950, you get $ 20
as a discount).
5. The percentage based discounts do not apply on phones.
6. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.
Write a program in java such that given a
bill, it finds the net payable amount. 
User interface is not required. 

What we care about:

Required Activities
• Object oriented programming approach, provide a high level UML class diagram of
all the key classes in your solution. This can either be on paper or using a CASE tool
• Code to be generic and simple
• Leverage today's best coding practices
• Clear README.md that explains how the code and the test can be run and how the
coverage reports can be generated
